# Lucky Five Video Poker
Online Demo is available at http://play.befive.info/lucky-five/

This is a very primitive example of video poker with php session keeping track of user credits. Please feel free to do anything about this code and all.

## To try this script

1. Make a directory in your web server and copy the content into it. Please make sure that your server can run php scripts.
2. Open http:://yourserver/the_directory_of_your_choice/index.html in your browser
- Note: You can still try the demo by simply double clicking index.html in your computer's desktop. But you will not hear any sound because of CORS issue (please [see here](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/6459-newbie-struggling-with-cors-issues/) for more info).
